# Tool Library
A tool lending simulation.

## Overview
Tool Library will be an web application which simulates a community tool lending platform. Users will be able to reserve tools they need via a searchable online catalog, send renewal requests, report broken or damaged items.

This project aims to:
- Simulate a community lending application
- Present a welcoming, user-friendly interface
- Showcase well documented, thoroughly tested, and soundly engineered code as the culminating final project of the Springboard Software Engineering Course.
- Raise awareness of the awesomeness of community tool libraries

The intended user demographic of this app includes anyone looking to explore the mechanics of a tool lending application via a simulation. Real-world user demographic is anyone looking to borrow a tool they need, to avoid having to purchase one.
